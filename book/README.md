# Introduction

Learning a new programming language can be hard sometimes, especially for those that have a steep learning curve. Rust belongs to that category but the effort is a worth it. Indeed, it is the language developers [love the most](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved)!.

Despite some [excellent resources](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn), Rust concepts are so unique they are still hard to grasp. So, my aim with this book is to propose a new approach that will hopefully resonate with developers left behind by other learning materials.

## Target audience

This guide is for developers who like the hands-on approach and are interested in software testing. A previous experience with another programming language will make things easier but is not required.

## How is this guide different from the others

As the name suggests, the approach in this series of tutorials is to learn the features of the languages while following test-driven development principles.

> Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later. *Wikipedia*

Testing is often absent from getting started guides although it is essential in the daily life of every developer.

## Prerequisites

A laptop with Rust installed.

As far as the installation is concerned, [this guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) will serve your purpose.

## Contact

I would love to hear from you, whether you have constructive feedback or anything you want to say. You can write an email to `author@learn-rust-with-tests.com`. I will do my best to reply in reasonable delays.

## Credits

This work takes its inspiration from the repo [Learn Go with tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests) that is a well-known resource for learning Go.

Also, thank you to [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) that is hosting this guide. Beautiful product that keeps improving day after day.
